Paddles: need
    Move Speed
    movement in one axis
    movement limits (stay on playing field)
    Size (Lenght,Widh,Height)
    collision with ball

Ball: needs
{
    Min Speed
    Max Speed
    OR
    fixed Speed
}
    visual form     (Square/Ball/somethign else)
    collision form  (Square/Ball/somethign else)
    Size

If rotation is added:
    Rotation
    Friction


Gameplay: possibilities
Wall bounce angles:
    {in angle = out angle
    OR
    out angle is impacted by ball rotation}

Paddle bounce angle:
    {in angle = out angle
    OR
    out angle is impacted by paddle Speed}


Dimensions:
playing field has to be same aspect ratio globally
(different screen cannot have different playing field aspect ratio)
scaling the field is the option to make game viewable on many devices

Speeds:
Opject speeds have to be in relation to playing field
(moving paddle from bottom to top should always take same time)


Ball movement:
M*X+N (straight line funciton)
Bounce angles:
(no spin)
alpha = beta (in angle = out angle)
(spin)
beta = alpha + (spin_direction*spin_spin_speed)*friction
                    ^                             ^
                 -1 or +1                        0-1
new spin = spin_speed*friction
